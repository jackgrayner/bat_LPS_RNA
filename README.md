## Abstract

Bats have attracted considerable recent interest for their longevity and ability to withstand infection by a range of pathogens, but few studies have examined immune responses as a function of age, sex, or social status. We investigated immune variation by comparing whole-blood transcriptomes of wild greater spear-nosed bats, Phyllostomus hastatus, before and after ex vivo exposure to lipopolysaccharide, a characteristic of gram-negative bacterial pathogens. This species exhibits an extreme harem-polygynous mating system, which has pervasive consequences on life history traits, including male-biased mortality. We observe strong interindividual variation in immune responses, with males and older bats each mounting stronger inflammatory responses. Males also show steeper patterns of age-related variation in immune profiles, suggesting their earlier mortality is associated with accelerated immunosenescence. We did not detect largescale differences in immune responses between males of different social status, suggesting that—unlike many primates—individual immune variation is not strongly influenced by social adversity. Our findings support recent calls for a more nuanced approach to understanding immune adaptations in bats that considers the multifarious ways in which species and individuals differ in ecology, resource allocation, and selection.

## Description of methods

We collected blood from bats in 50ul volume, which we either preserved or treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and incubated at 38C for 3 hours, prior to preservation. We sequenced whole transcriptomes of blood samples and investigated transcriptomic responses to LPS (a bacterial immune stimulus).

Gene expression counts were quantified against a reference transcriptome for Phyllostomus hastatus using Kallisto. Differential expression analyses were performed using DESeq2 in R.
